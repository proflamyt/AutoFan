# Auto Fan 


Auto Fan intelligently (using fuzzy logic which mimicks human reasoning) controls its speed based on the room temperature. It basically blows faster when it is hot and slower when its not. it increases it's speed based on the temprature of the room

It uses the nigeria temprature to determine this speed control, Autofan blows at it's mid when it is at 24-27C
